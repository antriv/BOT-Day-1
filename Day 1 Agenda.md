## Introduction
This tutorial will ramp up the attendee on the Microsoft cognitive APIs and Bot Framework, providing sample codes.  Components will be laid out for the attendee. The lecture and demo part will be for 1 and a ½ days. We’ll end this training with a ½ day hackathon. The attendee will get a chance to “bring their own scenario” to work on during the hackathon. Components will be laid out for the attendee so that in the end they will have a working smart bot .

##A list of pre-requisites is as follows:
1.	Visual Studio 2015 (Community version is ok) (could use Visual Studio Code on non-Windows systems – however most these instructions are working from Visual Studio) - download here
2.	A Microsoft Account to log into the Bot Framework developer portal, which you will use to register your Bot as well as to sign up for Cognitive Services subscriptions (if you have Hotmail, Live, Outlook.com, or an Xbox account then you already have a Microsoft Account).
3.	The Bot Framework Emulator from the Bot Framework Downloads page.
4.	The Bot Framework Visual Studio Template (C#) from the Bot Framework Downloads page.
5.	(Optional) Github for Windows (comes with Git Shell) or git on other systems to download this repository.
6.	(Optional) An Azure account for an Azure-accessible REST endpoint (for registering your bot with the Bot Framework service)
7.	(Optional) Developer accounts on one or more communication services (such as Facebook) where your Bot will communicate (Skype is already set up for you).
8.	(Optional) An Azure App Insights account to capture telemetry on your bot.
